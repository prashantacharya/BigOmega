If you know me well, you probably already know that I write blogs quite often. Most of the times the blogs I write are technical blogs, other contents I write are rare and occassional. Inspired by **Dan Abramov**, I wanted to create a personal blog website like he has. That is the primary motivation for creating this website.

### Reasons to create this website
At the start of 2019, I promised that I would write at least **52 blogs** in the year 2019 through [my blog](https://medium.com/@Prashacharya/looking-back-at-2018-with-commitments-for-2019-100-hrs-work-week-c5e068ed344e) on medium. To fulfill my commitment, I decided to create this website where I will write all of those blogs.

At the start of 2018, I had written a blog about the reasons to learn JavaScript in the upcoming days. You can read the blog [here](https://medium.com/@Prashacharya/should-you-learn-javascript-in-2018-dd61cc777bba). That blog now has over one thousand views. That also motivated me to create a platform of my own.

Things that I have been learning are so random that I have lost track of what I have learnt and what I know. So this is also going to be the platform where I will express and share what I have learnt so that it is going to be easier for me to track my progress over time.

### What will I share through this platform?
I have been writing technical blogs mostly. I will not stop doing that and I will continue sharing what I know through this platform. This is also a personal blog so I also plan about writing about my personal life through this platform.

### My next targets for the website
There are few targets that I want to meet for the website. They are
* Provide quality content on a frequent basis
* Add analytics feature in the site
* Add PWA functionalities in the website
* Subscribe to news letter

## A dedicated section for the ones who want to know how I created this website

This section is going to be a little bit technical so you are free to skip this content if you don't feel like reading it. This section has a purpose though. I have found people telling me how did you create the website, what tools did you use and so on. This section is for those people.

### Gatsby JS
[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) is a framework built on top of react which helps to create static websites. If you know react, it is pretty easy to learn. I followed Andrew Mead's tutorial titled [The Great Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM&t=15915s) to learn this amazing tool.

### Which CSS Library?
I always say that I am a terrible designer and I hate to design and write CSS. So I guess it is going to be a kind of surprise to you if I say I have used no library/a framework to design the UI of this website. The only library I have used is called [prism js](https://prismjs.com/) for code highlighting and except that, everything is written from scratch by me.

### React JS
React JS is a JavaScript library created by facebook to create User Interfaces. It is a great tool. I love using it and it has made me a better JavaScript Programmer.

### A lot of Gatsby Plugins
Gatsby JS has a lot of official plugins. I have used a lot of them in this website. You can check them out in their official documentation. The notable ones that I have used are 'gatsby-transformer-remark', 'gatsby-source-filesystem', 'gatsby-remark-prismjs' etc.
